# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

The current focus is on optimizing the trading functionality and improving system documentation. This includes addressing issues with 100% sell orders to prevent leftover amounts (dust) after trades, and creating comprehensive system flow documentation to enhance understanding of the system architecture. These efforts build upon the recent security enhancements, including IP-based validation for incoming webhook requests.

## Recent Changes

- **System Flow Documentation**: Created a comprehensive flow diagram documenting all components, functions, and their relationships in the webhook API system.
- **Spot Trading Optimization**: Modified the `executeSpotTrade` function to handle 100% sell orders correctly by using the exact maxSell value without rounding, preventing leftover amounts after trades.
- **IP-Based Validation**: Implemented IP validation as the first security check in the request processing pipeline, ensuring that only requests from whitelisted TradingView IP addresses are processed.
- **Enhanced Security Logging**: Added comprehensive logging for both successful and failed IP validations, providing a clear audit trail for security monitoring.
- **Rate Limiting Implementation**: Implemented OKX-compliant rate limiting (Trade: 60 req/s with burst to 120, Account: 10 req/s, Market data: 20 req/s).
- **Message Format Enhancement**: Updated Telegram message formatting with timestamps, trade configuration details, and improved error message clarity.
- **Security Improvements**: Enhanced input validation, authentication mechanisms, data protection, and error handling.

## Current Activities

- Optimizing trading functionality to prevent leftover amounts after trades
- Creating and maintaining comprehensive system documentation
- Implementing and testing security enhancements for the webhook API
- Reviewing the existing codebase to identify additional optimization opportunities
- Documenting the system architecture and implementation details
- Fixing webpack async/await compatibility issues
- Maintaining clean and precise logging

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Known Issues

1. **Webpack Compatibility**: There are ongoing issues with Webpack's compatibility with async/await, which need to be addressed for reliable operation.

2. **PnL Calculation**: The PnL calculation display in Telegram notifications is temporarily disabled and needs to be reimplemented.

3. **Rate Limit Monitoring**: Limited visibility into rate limit usage with potential for hitting rate limits during high volume.

4. **Error Recovery**: Limited automated recovery from certain error conditions that may require manual intervention.

### Planned Improvements

1. **Fix Webpack Compatibility Issues**: Resolve the issues with async/await to ensure reliable operation.

2. **Re-implement PnL Calculation**: Re-enable the PnL calculation and display in Telegram notifications.

3. **Test Multi-Account Execution**: Ensure reliable operation when executing orders across multiple accounts.

4. **Additional Security Enhancements**: 
   - Implement HTTP security headers
   - Consider moving IP whitelist to environment variables for easier management
   - Implement CIDR notation support for IP ranges
   - Add rate limiting for authentication attempts
   - Enhance logging for security events
   - Review and update dependencies for security patches

5. **Rate Limit Monitoring**: Monitor compliance with OKX API rate limits.

## Next Steps

1. Test the optimized spot trading functionality with various scenarios to ensure it correctly handles all trade types without leaving dust.

2. Integrate the system flow diagram into the project documentation.

3. Review other trading functions for similar optimization opportunities.

4. Test the IP validation implementation with various scenarios to ensure it correctly blocks unauthorized IPs and allows authorized ones.

5. Fix webpack async/await compatibility issue.

6. Verify error handling across all accounts.

7. Monitor rate limiting effectiveness.

8. Re-implement PnL calculation and display.

## Current Questions and Clarifications Needed

1. Are there other trading functions that could benefit from similar optimization to prevent leftover amounts?

2. What is the specific nature of the Webpack compatibility issues with async/await?

3. How was the PnL calculation implemented before it was disabled?

4. Are there any undocumented features or behaviors in the codebase?

5. What additional security measures could be implemented to further protect the webhook API?

6. Are there any performance implications of the added IP validation layer?
