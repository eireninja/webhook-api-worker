# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

The current focus is on ensuring robust security measures for the webhook API, specifically through implementing universal IP validation via middleware and eliminating security vulnerabilities. Secondary objectives include enhancing the visual presentation of Telegram notifications and extensive stress testing to validate system performance and scalability. These efforts build upon the recent security enhancements and system flow documentation.

## Recent Changes

- **Critical Security Vulnerability Fix**: Removed duplicate route handler that bypassed IP validation and implemented universal middleware-based IP validation for all routes and HTTP methods to prevent unauthorized access.
- **Universal IP Validation**: Implemented IP validation as a middleware that runs before any route handler, ensuring all requests regardless of path or method are validated against the TradingView IP whitelist.
- **DryRun Functionality Fix**: Modified the `executeMultiAccountTrades` function to pass the dryRun flag from the payload to each order object, ensuring that trades are not executed during stress testing.
- **Telegram Notification Enhancement**: Redesigned the trade notification format with bold headers, emojis, and improved visual hierarchy for better readability.
- **Build Process Improvement**: Fixed webpack dependency issues by moving webpack from devDependencies to dependencies, eliminating the need to run npm install before deployment.
- **Stress Testing**: Conducted comprehensive stress tests with up to 300 concurrent users, achieving 80+ requests per second with 100% success rate, validating the system's scalability.
- **System Flow Documentation**: Created a comprehensive flow diagram documenting all components, functions, and their relationships in the webhook API system.
- **Spot Trading Optimization**: Modified the `executeSpotTrade` function to handle 100% sell orders correctly by using the exact maxSell value without rounding, preventing leftover amounts after trades.
- **Enhanced Security Logging**: Added comprehensive logging for both successful and failed IP validations, providing a clear audit trail for security monitoring.
- **Rate Limiting Implementation**: Implemented OKX-compliant rate limiting (Trade: 60 req/s with burst to 120, Account: 10 req/s, Market data: 20 req/s).
- **Message Format Enhancement**: Updated Telegram message formatting with timestamps, trade configuration details, and improved error message clarity.
- **Security Audit Findings**: Conducted a comprehensive security audit of the OKX Trading Webhook API, identifying areas of strength and improvement.
- **Middleware-Based IP Validation Implementation**: Implemented a universal middleware-based IP validation approach as the first security check for all routes, ensuring consistent security validation regardless of path or HTTP method.

## Current Activities

- Securing the webhook API through comprehensive middleware-based validation
- Optimizing trading functionality to prevent leftover amounts after trades
- Creating and maintaining comprehensive system documentation
- Implementing and testing security enhancements for the webhook API
- Reviewing the existing codebase to identify additional optimization opportunities
- Fixing webpack async/await compatibility issues
- Maintaining clean and precise logging

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Known Issues

1. **Webpack Compatibility**: There are ongoing issues with Webpack's compatibility with async/await, which need to be addressed for reliable operation.

2. **PnL Calculation**: The PnL calculation display in Telegram notifications is temporarily disabled and needs to be reimplemented.

3. **Rate Limit Monitoring**: Limited visibility into rate limit usage with potential for hitting rate limits during high volume.

4. **Error Recovery**: Limited automated recovery from certain error conditions that may require manual intervention.

### Planned Improvements

1. **Fix Webpack Compatibility Issues**: Resolve the issues with async/await to ensure reliable operation.

2. **Re-implement PnL Calculation**: Re-enable the PnL calculation and display in Telegram notifications.

3. **Test Multi-Account Execution**: Ensure reliable operation when executing orders across multiple accounts.

4. **Additional Security Enhancements**: 
   - Implement HTTP security headers
   - Move IP whitelist to environment variables for easier management
   - Implement CIDR notation support for IP ranges
   - Add rate limiting for authentication attempts
   - Enhance logging for security events
   - Review and update dependencies for security patches

5. **Rate Limit Monitoring**: Monitor compliance with OKX API rate limits.

## Next Steps

1. Test the improved security implementation with various request types to ensure all routes are properly protected.

2. Validate that the IP whitelist is working as expected by testing with both allowed and disallowed IPs.

3. Test the optimized spot trading functionality with various scenarios to ensure it correctly handles all trade types without leaving dust.

4. Integrate the system flow diagram into the project documentation.

5. Review other trading functions for similar optimization opportunities.

6. Fix webpack async/await compatibility issue.

7. Verify error handling across all accounts.

8. Monitor rate limiting effectiveness.

9. Re-implement PnL calculation and display.

## Current Questions and Clarifications Needed

1. Are there other areas of the codebase that could benefit from middleware-based security features?

2. Are there other trading functions that could benefit from similar optimization to prevent leftover amounts?

3. What is the specific nature of the Webpack compatibility issues with async/await?

4. How was the PnL calculation implemented before it was disabled?

5. Are there any undocumented features or behaviors in the codebase?

6. What additional security measures could be implemented to further protect the webhook API?

7. Are there any performance implications of the added IP validation middleware?
