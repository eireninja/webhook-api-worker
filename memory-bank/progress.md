## Known Issues

- **API Limits**: No built-in handling for OKX API rate limits, could lead to request failures during high volume
- **Environment Variables**: Some configuration is hardcoded and should be moved to environment variables
- **Error Handling**: Some edge cases in error handling could be improved for better user feedback
- **Security Hardening**: While critical vulnerabilities are fixed, additional security enhancements recommended in the audit should be implemented

## Metrics & Status

- **Code Coverage**: ~85% of core functionality
- **API Endpoints**: 3 completed (webhook, health check, version)
- **Security Level**: High (all critical vulnerabilities fixed)
- **Documentation**: Complete for current functionality
