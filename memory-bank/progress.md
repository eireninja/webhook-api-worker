# Project Progress

## What Works

- **API Endpoints**: Basic API routing is implemented and functional
- **Authentication**: Multi-layered security with IP validation and token-based authentication
- **Payload Validation**: Input validation for trade parameters
- **Database Integration**: D1 database integration for API key storage
- **Multi-Account Trading**: Execution of trades across multiple accounts
- **Trade Type Support**: Support for spot, USDT perpetual futures, and inverse perpetual futures
- **Leverage Management**: Setting leverage for futures trading
- **Telegram Notifications**: Basic trade notifications via Telegram
- **Logging**: Comprehensive logging system with security event tracking
- **IP-Based Security**: Validation of incoming requests against TradingView IP whitelist

## What's Left to Build

1. **Fix Webpack Compatibility Issues**: Resolve issues with async/await compatibility
2. **Reimplementation of PnL Calculation**: Re-enable PnL calculations in notifications
3. **Enhanced Error Handling**: Improve error handling and recovery mechanisms
4. **Additional Security Features**: Implement remaining security enhancements (IP whitelist in env vars, CIDR support)
5. **Documentation Improvements**: Update and expand documentation
6. **Testing Framework**: Develop comprehensive testing framework
