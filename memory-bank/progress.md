# Project Progress

## What Works

- **API Endpoints**: Basic API routing is implemented and functional
- **Authentication**: Multi-layered security with IP validation and token-based authentication
- **Payload Validation**: Input validation for trade parameters
- **Database Integration**: D1 database integration for API key storage
- **Multi-Account Trading**: Execution of trades across multiple accounts
- **Trade Type Support**: Support for spot, USDT perpetual futures, and inverse perpetual futures
- **Leverage Management**: Setting leverage for futures trading
- **Telegram Notifications**: Enhanced trade notifications with improved formatting and visual hierarchy
- **Logging**: Comprehensive logging system with security event tracking
- **IP-Based Security**: Validation of incoming requests against TradingView IP whitelist
- **System Documentation**: Comprehensive flow diagram documenting all system components and functions
- **Spot Trading Optimization**: Improved handling of 100% sell orders to prevent leftover amounts (dust)
- **DryRun Mode**: Fully functional dry run mode that simulates trades without executing them
- **Build Process**: Streamlined deployment process with correct dependency management
- **Performance Validation**: Stress-tested with up to 300 concurrent users at 80+ requests/second

## What's Left to Build

1. **Fix Webpack Compatibility Issues**: Resolve issues with async/await compatibility
2. **Reimplementation of PnL Calculation**: Re-enable PnL calculations in notifications
3. **Enhanced Error Handling**: Improve error handling and recovery mechanisms
4. **Additional Security Features**: Implement remaining security enhancements (IP whitelist in env vars, CIDR support)
5. **Documentation Improvements**: Continue updating and expanding documentation
6. **Testing Framework**: Develop comprehensive testing framework

## Known Issues

1. **Webpack Compatibility**: Issues with async/await in Webpack bundling process
   - **Impact**: Potential reliability issues during deployment
   - **Status**: Under investigation

2. **PnL Calculation**: PnL calculation in Telegram notifications is disabled
   - **Impact**: Limited visibility into trade performance
   - **Status**: Needs reimplementation

3. **Rate Limit Monitoring**: Limited visibility into rate limit usage
   - **Impact**: Potential for hitting rate limits during high volume
   - **Status**: Needs enhancement

4. **Error Recovery**: Limited automated recovery from certain error conditions
   - **Impact**: May require manual intervention in some failure scenarios
   - **Status**: Needs improvement
