# Current Task Status

## Active Objectives
- Optimizing individual order execution
- Fixing webpack async/await compatibility issues
- Maintaining clean and precise logging
- Implementing OKX-compliant rate limiting
- Completing comprehensive security audit
- Enhancing input validation
- Improving error handling

## Current Context
- Working on multi-account trading optimization
- Focus on reliable individual order execution
- Webpack build system issues with async/await
- Improved error handling and logging system
- Consolidated trade summary generation
- Rate limiting implementation aligned with OKX specifications
- Conducting security audit with focus on:
  - Input validation
  - Authentication mechanisms
  - Injection vulnerabilities
  - Client-side security
  - Error handling
  - Configuration security

## Recent Changes
- Implemented OKX-compliant rate limiting
  - Trade endpoints: 60 req/s with burst to 120
  - Account endpoints: 10 req/s
  - Market data: 20 req/s
- Added per-account rate limiting
- Standardized size formatting using toFixed(8)
- Consolidated logging in single point of execution
- Updated Telegram message formatting
  - Added timestamp to all message types with format "⏰ Time: HH:MM" (24-hour)
  - Fixed PnL display issue by temporarily disabling it (passing null)
  - Added new fields to trade messages:
    - Leverage (⚡)
    - Margin Mode (💵)
    - Entry Price (📈)
- Enhanced input validation in the `validatePayload` function
  - Added validation for required fields
  - Implemented type checking
  - Added range validation for inputs
- Improved error handling with structured responses
  - Added appropriate HTTP status codes
  - Prevented sensitive information leakage
  - Implemented consistent error formatting
- Enhanced authentication mechanism
  - Strengthened token validation
  - Implemented proper error messages for auth failures
- Improved sensitive data handling
  - Added masking for account IDs
  - Implemented redaction for API keys in logs
  - Secured error messages against information disclosure

## Next Steps
1. Fix webpack async/await compatibility issue
2. Test individual order execution reliability
3. Verify error handling across all accounts
4. Document updated trade execution behavior
5. Monitor rate limiting effectiveness
6. Re-implement PnL calculation and display
7. Consider adding additional trade details like:
   - Total trade value in USD
   - Execution time metrics
   - Position details for leveraged trades
8. Complete remaining security audit recommendations:
   - Implement HTTP security headers
   - Add rate limiting for authentication attempts
   - Enhance logging for security events
   - Review and update dependencies for security patches
